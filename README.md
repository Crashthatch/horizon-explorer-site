## Horizon Explorer - App Description

Point your camera at a hill, village, lake or landmark on the horizon and Horizon Explorer will augment the camera view with the name, distance, altitude and map of the point you're aiming at. 

Fly up high and see the terrain laid out below you to see what is over the hills around you, and get the lay of the land, then see the scale-model 3D map that you can walk around & explore to find out what's behind hills, or investigate up close.

Horizon Explorer uses Unity, ARCore, ARKit, Mapbox, with data from OpenStreetMap.
